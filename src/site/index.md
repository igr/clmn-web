## üöÄ Multiple columns at once

Visibility is essential. `Clmn` displays multiple task columns simultaneously, providing an overview of all tasks within the same domain.

Tasks within a list may be further organized into groups.

Lists + Groups + Tasks == Get Things Done.

## ‚ö° Nothing fancy, just enough

There is nothing fancy about `Clmn`. A task is simply a task, and that's all. Everything else distracts from the focus.

`Clmn` offers just enough functionality:

- Order tasks in _lists_ and _groups_.
- _Complete_ a task. <kbd>Click</kbd>
- Mark tasks as _in progress_. <kbd>‚åò + Click</kbd>
- _Cancel_ a task. <kbd>‚å• + Click</kbd>
- _Drag'n'drop_ tasks around the board.
- Coloured backgrounds for tasks.
- _Select_ a task and show _notes_ with details.
- Use _markdown_ for all text.
- _Link_ to tasks using URLs.
- Use _keyboard_: <kbd>‚åò + ‚èé</kbd> to save, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to dismiss.

## üéÅ How much it costs?

`Clmn` is _free_. It is [open-source](https://github.com/igr/Clmn) as well.

It takes time and effort to develop, distribute, maintain, and provide support for the app. If you enjoy using it, please consider supporting us by [purchasing it](https://apple.co/3NaYgTw). Your support would be greatly appreciated! Thank you very much! üôè

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQ

### > I hate hover buttons!

No worries! Turn off this feature in the settings :)

### > What about my co-workers?

`Clmn` is a local app, exclusive to your tasks only.

### > No due dates or calendar or...?

No stars, important flags, priorities, sublists, even due dates, reminders, pomodoros... `Clmn` is not that kind of app. Instead, it intentionally keeps things super simple: less is more. You either dedicate yourself to your tasks or find an excuse :)

New features will be added very thoughtfully.

### > iOS love?

`Clmn` is currently a Mac-only application. It is designed for professionals that spend most of their time behind big screens and laptops. We are considering making an iOS app, but not any time soon.
