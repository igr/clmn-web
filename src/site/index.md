`Clmn` is a beautiful task board native app for macOS. It is thoughtfully simple and unbearably efficient; nothing fancy, just enough. `Clmn` is designed for professionals that work mostly on laptops.

## üöÄ Multiple columns at once

Visibility is essential. `Clmn` shows multiple task columns at once. That gives an overview of all tasks that belong to the same domain.

Tasks within a list may be further organized into groups.

Lists + Groups + Tasks == Get Things Done.

## ‚ö° Nothing fancy, just enough

There is nothing fancy in `Clmn`. A task is a task, and that is all. Everything else takes the focus away.

`Clmn` offers just enough functionalities:

- Order tasks in _lists_ and _groups_.
- _Complete_ a task. <kbd>Click</kbd>
- Mark tasks as _in progress_. <kbd>‚åò + Click</kbd>
- _Cancel_ a task. <kbd>‚å• + Click</kbd>
- _Drag'n'drop_ tasks around the board.
- Coloured backgrounds for tasks.
- _Select_ a task and show _notes_ with details.
- Use _markdown_ for all text.
- _Link_ to tasks using URLs.
- Use _keyboard_: <kbd>‚åò + ‚èé</kbd> to save, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to dismiss.

## üéÅ How much it costs?

`Clmn` is _free_. It is open-source as well.

It takes time and effort to develop, distribute, maintain, and provide support. If you like the app, please consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/igr?sponsor=igr). That would help us a lot! Thank you very much! üôè


## üîÆ Future plans

One word: _integrations_. The idea is to integrate `Clmn` boards with various 3rd parties: Reminders, Github project, Jira, etc. Each `Clmn` board integration would show your tasks only so that you can stay focused on your work.

We can't promise we will ever get enough resources to develop integrations, but we are allowed to dream :)


## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQ

### > I hate hover buttons!

No worries! Turn off this feature in the settings.

### > What about my co-workers?

`Clmn` is a local app, sorry. Your tasks, only.

### > No due dates or calendar or...?

No stars, important flags, priorities, sublists, even due dates, reminders, pomodoros... `Clmn` is not that kind of app. Instead, it is super simple on purpose: the less is more. You either dedicate to your tasks, or find an excuse :)

New features will be added very thoughtfully.

### > iOS love?

`Clmn` is currently a Mac-only application. It is designed for professionals that spend most of their time behind big screens and laptops. We are considering making an iOS app, but not any time soon.
