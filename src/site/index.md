`Clmn` is a beautiful task board native app for macOS. It is thoughtfully simple and unbearably efficient; nothing fancy, just enough. `Clmn` is designed for professionals that work mostly on laptops.

## üöÄ Multiple columns at once

Visibility is essential. `Clmn` shows multiple task columns at once. That gives an overview of all tasks that belong to the same domain.

Tasks within a list may be further organized into groups.

Lists + Groups + Tasks == Get Things Done.

## ‚ö° Nothing fancy, just enough

There is nothing fancy in `Clmn`. A task is a task, and that is all. Everything else takes the focus away.

`Clmn` offers just enough functionalities:

- Order tasks in _lists_ and _groups_.
- _Complete_ a task. <kbd>Click</kbd>
- Mark tasks as _in progress_. <kbd>‚åò + Click</kbd>
- _Cancel_ a task. <kbd>‚å• + Click</kbd>
- _Drag'n'drop_ tasks around the board.
- Coloured backgrounds for tasks.
- _Select_ a task and show _notes_ with details.
- Use _markdown_ for all text.
- _Link_ to tasks using URLs.
- Use _keyboard_: <kbd>‚åò + ‚èé</kbd> to save, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to dismiss.

## üéÅ How much it costs?

`Clmn` is _free_. It is [open-source](https://github.com/igr/Clmn) as well.

It takes time and effort to develop, distribute, maintain, and provide support. If you like the app, please consider [buying](https://github.com/sponsors/igr?sponsor=igr). That would help us a lot! Thank you very much! üôè


## üîÆ Future plans

`Clmn` is a young app. It is already useful, but there is a lot of room for improvement. Here are some ideas:

+ [ ] _Search_ for tasks.
+ [ ] _Filter_ tasks.
+ [ ] _Sort_ tasks by priority.
+ [ ] _Share_ tasks with others.
+ [ ] _Customize_ colours.
+ [ ] _Customize_ fonts.
+ [ ] Attach images to tasks.

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQ

### > I hate hover buttons!

No worries! Turn off this feature in the settings :)

### > What about my co-workers?

`Clmn` is a local app, sorry. Your tasks, only.

### > No due dates or calendar or...?

No stars, important flags, priorities, sublists, even due dates, reminders, pomodoros... `Clmn` is not that kind of app. Instead, it is super simple on purpose: the less is more. You either dedicate to your tasks, or find an excuse :)

New features will be added very thoughtfully.

### > iOS love?

`Clmn` is currently a Mac-only application. It is designed for professionals that spend most of their time behind big screens and laptops. We are considering making an iOS app, but not any time soon.
